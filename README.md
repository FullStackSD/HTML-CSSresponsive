## Testing 


- I tested this page using different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

- I confirmed this project as responsive. I made sure there was a pleasant user experience and functions well on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device in the toolbar.

- All sections listed above are easily readable and understandable.

- The form is interactive and works well. It requires the user to enter specific details into each field ie. the email field will only accept email etc.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Bugs 

#### Solved Bugs

- When I was creating a responsive nav bar hamburger menu, I realised the z-index was incorrect and therefore was hiding my whole navigavtion behind the hero image. 

- My solution was to change the position to absolute and add a z-index of 2. I also added opacity of .7 for an enjoyable user experience.
