                <h2>Via de la Plata</h2>
                <p>Not for the faint hearted. The Via de la Plata is renowned for it's harsh terrain and unforgiving heat, depending on
                    the month you're walking. Setting out from the capital and largest city of the Spanish autonomous community of
                    Andalusia you will walk <b>1300km</b> north until you reach Sanitgo de Compostela.
                    The route rewards you with breath-taking views and even better cultural experiences.
                     only 3.5% of all peregrinos embarking on their camino choose to take this route making it ideal for those
                    wanting step off the beaten track.

                <h2>Finisterre</h2>
                <p>The Camino Finisterre is a 90km trail from Santiago to Finisterra, on the western coast of Spain. The three- to
                    four-day journey traverses the rugged countryside of Galicia, with its Celtic heritage.
                    <br> Medieval pilgrims believed that Finisterre (Latin, meaning “the end of the world”) was literally the end of the
                    world.

            <h2>Camino Primitivo</h2>
        <p>The Camino Primitivo is a <b>321 km</b>pilgrimage through Northern Spain, starting in Oviedo and finishing at the
            cathedral in Santiago de Compostela. The route crosses sparsely populated mountainous areas, with impressive
            lanscapes filled with natural beauty and almost no asphalt stretches (hurray for our feet!).
            <br> In addition, the historical and patrimonial resources are abundant, especially in the two monumental cities
            that we visit on our route, Oviedo and Lugo, as well as Compostela itself, which awaits us on our arrival.

                    <p>Folk undertake The Camino of their choice for many reasons. Whatever those reasons, the sense of achievement on successful completion cannot be denied! The added reward is being exposed to Spanish cultures (yes - plural, because every section or region offers something slightly unique), Spanish cuisine, hospitality, architecture and history, none of which can be experienced to the levels and depths except by walking The Ways. There is pride in knowing the challenges of physical efforts to reach the days end have been met - and the bonus is treating yourself to a well earned Cafe con Leche!!</p>

                    <p>This Camino from Santiago to Finisterra did not disappoint. There is some marvellous coastal scenery and rural landscapes. You will find plenty of cheap and welcoming hostels and hotels for your accommodation. Plenty of ups and downs, none too challenging, the views are definitely worth the climb. Take time to look around you, one step at a time!!</p>

                    <h2>Walking alone on the Camino Primitivo</h2>
                    <p>I chose to walk the 334km Camino Primitivo to Santiago de Compostela over 13 days. The route was fabulous and the views to die for. The sunny weather was a blessing, considering I was in North Spain in mountains in September/October. I saw the real Spain and met some fantastic people along the way. It was a walk you could spend lots of time by yourself along the way or tag along with people as and when. The food was delicious too!</p>
