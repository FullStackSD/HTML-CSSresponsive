                <h2>Finisterre</h2>
                <p>The Camino Finisterre is a 90km trail from Santiago to Finisterra, on the western coast of Spain. The three- to
                    four-day journey traverses the rugged countryside of Galicia, with its Celtic heritage.
                    <br> Medieval pilgrims believed that Finisterre (Latin, meaning “the end of the world”) was literally the end of the
                    world.

            <h2>Camino Primitivo</h2>
        <p>The Camino Primitivo is a <b>321 km</b>pilgrimage through Northern Spain, starting in Oviedo and finishing at the
            cathedral in Santiago de Compostela. The route crosses sparsely populated mountainous areas, with impressive
            lanscapes filled with natural beauty and almost no asphalt stretches (hurray for our feet!).
            <br> In addition, the historical and patrimonial resources are abundant, especially in the two monumental cities
            that we visit on our route, Oviedo and Lugo, as well as Compostela itself, which awaits us on our arrival.
